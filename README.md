# ðŸš€ SpaceX Launch Viewer (Tech Test)

The task was to create a React application that will consume data from the SpaceX public API. The application must retrieve historic and future SpaceX launches and present them in a list view.

This application was written in TypeScript and unit tested with Jest.

## 3rd Party Packages Used: 
- **React Query** - Server state management.
- **Styled Components** - CSS-in-JS styling solution.
- **Polished** - CSS-in-JS utility.
- **Moment** - Date formatting.

### Additional Notes
I wasn't sure if the number on each launch card referred to the flight number or its position in the list. I opted to use the flight number which is why some launch numbers appear out of order when they are sorted by date.
